# Amazon_Review_Analysis
Traditional vs Deep Learning Classifiers Performance analysis using amazon product reviews.

In this work, we present the relationship of model performance with varying dataset size and the varying number of target classes. Amazon product reviews used as the dataset for the experimentation.
